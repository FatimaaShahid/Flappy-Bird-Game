# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game — Python + Pygame

A visually charming, smooth, and addictive clone of the original **Flappy Bird**, built in **Python using Pygame**. Designed for fun and for learning, this project demonstrates game development principles such as animation, physics, collision detection, and event handling.

## ▶️ How to Play

> **Your goal:** Pass through the pipes without hitting them or the ground. The longer you survive, the higher your score!

**Controls:**
- `SPACE` or mouse click to flap the bird upward
- Don’t hit the pipes or fall to the ground
